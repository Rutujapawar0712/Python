File I/O:
 To perform operations (Read / Write) on files.


■ File Open:

⫸ Syntax:
f = open("FileName.Ext", "Mode")


# Code - Open File
i)
f = open("DemoFile.txt")                # Default Mode is "r" / "rt"   
or
with open("DemoFile.txt", "r") as f:
  print(f.read())

- O/P.:
  # It will open a file in read mode.
 


■ File Close:

# Code - Close File
i)
f.close()

- O/P.:
 # It will close the file.



■ Type of Files:

1) Text Mode ("t"):
    Text Files: .txt, .docx, .log, etc.

# Code - Text Data
i)
f = open("DemoFile.txt", "rt")          # Default Mode

- O/P.:
 # It will open file in Text Read mode.



2) Binary Mode ("b"):
    Binary Files: .jpg, .png, .mp4, etc.
   
# Code - Binary Data
i)
f = open("DemoFile.mp4", "rb")

- O/P.:
 # It will open file in Binary Read mode.



■ Modes:

1) Create Mode ("x"): 
    It will create a new file if and only if there is no file already in existence with that name or else it will return an error.

# Code - Create a New File
i)
f = open("DemoFile.txt", "x")

- O/P.:
FileExistsError: 'DemoFile.txt'



2) Read Mode ("r"):
    Open text file for reading. The pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file.

# Code - Read File
i)
f = open("DemoFile.txt", "r")           # Default Value

print(f.read())
or
print(f.read(15))                       # (No. of Characters)
or
for data in f:
  print(data)

f.close()

- O/P.:
"Hello World !!!" 


⫸ ReadLine: 
    Using the readline-after-read method will provide There is no output because the pointer has already reached the last line of characters.
    It will give a blank line in the output if the file contains multiple lines of data where a line ends with an unseen next line character (\n or Enter).

# Code - ReadLine Data
i) 
f = open("DemoFile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())                     # Read Single Line at a Time
f.close()

- O/P.:
"Hello World !!!"



3) Write Mode ("w"):
    Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing if it does not exist. The pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file.

# Code - Write to a File
i)
f = open("DemoFile.txt", "w")
f.write("I am learning Python.")        # OverWrite the Entire File
f.close()

- O/P.: 
 # Text File O/P.:
I am learning Python.


⫸ Writelines:
    This function inserts multiple strings at the same time. A list of string elements is created, and each string is then added to the text file.

# Code - WriteLine Data
i) 
f = open("DemoFile.txt", "w")
f.writelines(["Hello World !!!", "\nI am learning Python."])
f.close()

- O/P.:
 # Text File O/P.:
Hello World !!!
I am learning Python.



4) Append Mode ("a"):
    Open text file for writing and create new file if it does not exist. The pointer is positioned at the end of the file.

# Code - Append Data to a File
i)
f = open("DemoFile.txt", "a")
f.write("\nNext we will start learning JS.")      # Add New Data at the End of File
f.close()

- O/P.:
 # Text File O/P.:
Hello World !!!
I am learning Python.
Next we will start learning JS.
