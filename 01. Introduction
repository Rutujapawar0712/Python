■ Python History:
   It was made by "Guido Van Rassom" in "1991".



■ Python programs can be written on different IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):
1) Command Prompt
2) Notepad / Notepad++
3) Pycharm
4) Jupitor Notebook
5) Visual Studio
6) Git / Github
7) Replit


⫸ After Python download, open cmd (command prompt):

1) To check if Python is correctly installed or not.

python --version


2) To run the program directly from the cmd.
   (Only a single line of code will be executed and cannot be saved.)

python
  // code
  ...
exit()


3) To check the output on cmd for the program written on a notepad.
    
python "filename".py



■ Modules:
   A module is a code library that contains a set of functions for inclusion in your application.

▪ 1) External Modules:
      It can be installed / uninstalled using a package manager like 'pip' / 'conda'.
                             
      Ex.: Write "pip install pandas" on cmd / terminal, and then
           Write "import pandas" in code.   


▪ 2) Build-in Modules:
      No need to install them explicitly.


▪ 3) User Define Modules:
      Users can create function modules and use them in the main file to better organize and reuse code.

# Code - Addition.py 

def Add(a, b):
  sum = a + b 
  print("Addition = ", sum)

# Code - Main.py

from Addition import Add
Add(7, 10)
 #or
import Addition
Addition.Add(7, 10)

O/P.:
Addition = 17
