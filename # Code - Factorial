ðŸ¤” Q. Write a program to find the factorial of first n Number.

# Code

No = int(input("Enter Number = "))
Fact = 1

for x in range(1, No+1):
  Fact = Fact*x
  
print("Factorial = ", Fact)


- O/P.:
Enter Number = 7
Factorial = 5040




ðŸ¤” Q. Write a program to find factorial of n using function. (n is the parameter)

# Code

def Factorial(n):
  Fact = 1

  for x in range(1, n+1):
    Fact = Fact * x

  print("Factorial = ", Fact)

No = int(input("Enter No. = "))
Factorial(No)


- O/P.:
Enter No. = 7
Factorial = 5040




ðŸ¤” Q. Write a program to find the sum of natural number.

# Code

No = int(input("Enter Number = "))
Count = 1
Sum = 0

while Count <= No:
  Sum = Sum + Count
  Count += 1
  
print("Total Sum = ", Sum)


- O/P.:
Enter Number = 7
Total Sum = 28
